        <p><i>Perceptions of Patterns</i></p>
        <p>This experiment aims to examine how people make sense of their world and perceive patterns that may or may
            not exist in the real world. Human beings are remarkably skilled at identifying and perceiving patterns in
            the world around them, be it in sound (e.g. detecting a melody), event (e.g. detecting a causal sequence),
            or
            in objects (e.g. detecting subtle asymmetries). In fact, it has been suggested that human beingsâ€™ ability to
            perceive and process patterns may be what makes the human brain so unique in nature (see Logan &amp; Tandoc,
            2018; Mattson, 2014). At the same time, people often perceive patterns that may not be there, such as words
            in a series of random sounds or faces in objects.</p>

        <p>As a part of this study, you were asked to look at a series of images, which were either shown by themselves
            or in groups. These images and grouping differed in how related the features were. In some cases, there was
            an intentional pattern in what you saw. In other cases, what you saw was more or less random, with some
            cases
            falling somewhere between these two extremes. We were interested in both how well you were able to
            differentiate between images with and without patterns. We were also interested in how differing levels of
            pattern and randomness may change how things are perceived. </p>

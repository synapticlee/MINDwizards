                This is an anonymous survey consisting of multiple questions. A few questions are open-ended
                questions
                where you need to type a few sentences or a short paragraph or two. Many MTurk workers do not like
                answering open-ended questions and tend to quit a
                survey once they see such questions.
                <strong>
                    If a sizable number of people quit a survey halfway, the
                    data
                    quality of that survey would be compromised. However, our research depends on good quality
                    data.
                </strong>
                Thus, please make sure you do not mind
                open-ended questions before taking this survey.
                <br><br>
                Please type the following sentence into the box below exactly as written if you still want
                to take the survey: <em>I will answer open-ended questions.</em>

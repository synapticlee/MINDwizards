        <p>You are being invited to take part in a research study being conducted by the Todorov Lab in the Department
            of Psychology at Princeton University. Before you decide to participate in this study, it is important that
            you understand why the research
            is being done and what it will involve. Please take the time to read the following information carefully, as
            it contains important information about the study and your rights as a research participant.</p>

        <p>This research project concerns psychological processes. The experiment will ask you to answer simple
            questions and/or perform simple tasks by interacting with a Web survey. Your data will be pooled with those
            of others, and your responses will be
            completely anonymous. However, we will keep the data obtained for all participants for possible use in other
            scientific publications.</p>
        <p>

            We expect that this experiment will take only about <strong>{{duration}}</strong> and carries no foreseeable
            risks
            and/or
            benefits beyond any compensation that you may receive and the knowledge that you are helping to improve our
            knowledge of human psychology.</p>

        <p>
            Due to the nature of psychology experiments, we cannot explain the precise purpose of the experiment until
            after the session is over, but you will be asked to make judgments or decisions about what you see as part
            of this study. You will be given more
            specific instructions as you go about the tasks.</p>

        <p>
            Afterwards, the experimenter will be happy to answer any questions you might have about the procedure. You
            will receive the reward specified on the Mechanical-Turk HIT for participating. Your participation is
            completely voluntary. You are free to decline
            to participate or to end participation at any time for any reason without penalty.</p>

        <p><u><b> Confidentiality:</b></u>
            <br> All records from this study will be kept confidential. Your responses will be kept private, and we will
            not include any information that will make it possible to identify you in any report we might publish.
            Research records will be stored
            securely in a locked cabinet and/or on password-protected computers. The research team will be the only
            party
            that will have access to your data.

            <br>Anonymous data (without your name) may be presented at research meetings and published in research
            journals. </p>
        <p>
            <u><b>Compensation:</b></u> <br> You will be paid ${{compensation}} for {{duration}} of participation.

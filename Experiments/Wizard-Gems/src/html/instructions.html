        You are a wizard's apprentice, learning to buy magical gems for the wizard.
        The wizard is training you by letting you guess the value of different gems
        and then telling you the real value.</p>

    <p class="instructions text-left">
        Through his feedback on your guesses you must learn how to quickly
        and accurately estimate the value of new gems on your own when the wizard
        isn't around to help.
    </p>
    <p class="instructions text-left">
        Here's an example of what your task looks like:
    </p>
    <img class="instructions text-center" src="src/images/example.png">
    <p class="instructions text-left">
        The size of the bars on the left side represent the level of different kinds
        of magic that each gem possesses. The size of these magic power bars
        goes into determining the gem's value represented by the size of the bar on the right.
    </p>
    <p class="instructions text-left">
        It's important to note that the wizard does not necessarily care about
        all kinds of magic equally. Some bars may be more important others.
    </p>
    <p class="instructions text-left">
        You start by guessing a value by clicking on the value bar on the right with your mouse.
    </p>
    <p class="instructions text-left">
        The wizard will give you feedback so you can learn how to value gems.
        You must use the wizard's feedback to figure out which magic powers he cares
        about most and least. Then you can use what you've learned to help when he isn't around.
